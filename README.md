# About the Repository
This application is still in development stage with lots of issues and bugs although there are lots of improvements and milestones achieved. 
This app is actively being worked on by interns of Rental Listing App team of [Melham Construction Corporation (MCC)](https://dev-melhamconstruction.pantheonsite.io/). <br />
<br /> **Only interns and employees of MCC may able to contribute to this repository.**

### Overview
This project is being worked on **Android Studio** using **Java** (back-end, middle-end), **XML** (front-end, UI/UX)
and **Firebase Realtime Database** (back-end). New interns, if you have little-to-no experience to one or more of
those, you can view the following resources:
* [Java Documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/)
* [Official Firebase Guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/guides)
* [XML Language Tutorial by W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/)
* [Google's Documentation for Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/guide)

### Prerequisites
If you are a new intern and already joined as a contributor, you will need to install the following:
* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
* [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)
* [OpenJDK version 18](https://jdk.java.net/18/) (optional - might be required if generating SHA-1 key) <br />

You will also need to join the Discord server of Front-End and Back-End teams, Facebook group chat for MCC Rental Listing Team and our Trello workspace. You will need to ask your team leaders for links.<br />
For Firebase database access, ask the team leader or back-end leader for Firebase account. <br />
Working with the repository in the Android Studio requires repository cloning. To do that:
* Launch your Android Studio.
* Click 'Get from VCS'.
* Login your Github account.
* Select the LetnGo repository.
* Select which folder in your directory you will clone.
* Click clone and wait for Android Studio to install additional components. Make sure that Gradle components are properly installed.

For testing and debugging the app, you may use the Android Studio emulator (although it requires additional installs). Alternatively, you can use a third-party emulators like LDPlayer 9 or Bluestacks or an Android Smartphone (should be Android 10 or later) and enable USB debugging (requires enabling Developer option).

### Contribution Guide
Here are some guidelines when developing the app:
* Front-end and back-end team leaders and members need to work together. It is recommended to use Discord voice chat for collaboration.
* Tasks should be properly distributed by team leaders according to the development timeline. Use Trello to keep on track.
* Bugs and issues discovered in the app should be listed and addressed to each members and leaders.
* **IMPORTANT!!!** When working on a certain XML or Java file, tell your members exactly the file you are working on. Pushing your code in a same file that your other member worked on will cause merging issues and will reject the push. It is suggested to use Pull Request and review the codes together or alternatively, talk to your fellow member that is working with the same file you are working on to review and compare codes before pushing and merging.
